# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document describes the workflow and rules that all contributors — human and AI — must follow.

## Workflow Overview

Every change follows this path:

```
Issue → Branch → PR (linked to issue) → CI passes → Merge → Branch auto-deleted
```

No exceptions. PRs without a linked issue will be blocked by CI.

## Step 1: Create an Issue

Every change starts with a GitHub issue. Use one of the provided templates:

- **Bug Report** — for bugs and unexpected behavior
- **Feature Request** — for new features and improvements
- **Documentation** — for docs improvements or missing content

Blank issues are disabled. Pick the template that best fits your change.

## Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

Branch from `main` using one of these naming conventions:

| Prefix | Use for | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features | `feature/42-add-rate-limiting` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/17-correct-threshold-calc` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/8-update-setup-guide` |

Format: `<prefix>/<issue-number>-short-description`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/42-add-rate-limiting
```

## Step 3: Make Changes and Commit

- Write small, focused commits
- Use conventional commit messages:
  - `feat: add rate limiting configuration`
  - `fix: correct threshold calculation`
  - `docs: update setup guide`

## Step 4: Open a Pull Request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
2. **Link the issue** — use `Closes #42` in the PR description, or link from the sidebar
3. Fill out the PR template (it loads automatically)
4. The **"Check linked issues"** CI check will block merge if no issue is linked

## Step 5: Review and Merge

- All CI checks must pass before merge
- Auto-merge is enabled — PRs merge automatically once all checks pass
- Squash merge is preferred
- The branch is automatically deleted after merge (`delete_branch_on_merge` is enabled)

## Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected. The following rules are enforced:

- No direct pushes to `main` — all changes go through PRs
- No force pushes
- Required status check: **"Check linked issues"** must pass
- Admin enforcement enabled — these rules apply to everyone

## AI Assistant Guidelines

If you are Claude Code, Copilot, or another AI coding assistant, follow these rules:

1. **Always create a GitHub issue before writing code.** No issue = no work.
2. **Always work on a feature branch.** Never commit directly to `main`.
3. **Always link the PR to the issue.** Use `Closes #N` in the PR description.
4. **Use the `/ship` skill** when available — it handles the full Issue → Branch → PR flow.
5. **Never force push** or attempt to bypass branch protection.
6. **Fill out the PR template checklist** completely.
7. **Follow the branch naming convention**: `feature/<issue>-desc`, `fix/<issue>-desc`, `docs/<issue>-desc`.
8. **Respect CODEOWNERS** — `@robinmordasiewicz` is the default reviewer.
